<h1>pgb-viewer-test</h1>

<p>This is a page for playing around with embedding windows to Google Docs in a Gh page using an i-frame. I'm trying it now with an IO page which seems to be required.</p>
<p>Now I am editing the file in docs folder which seems to be the place that's being published. </p>
<p>Well, so far, the page doesn't seem to be updating. I am changing to a different spread sheet though that i can share with anyone. </p>

<p>Let's also see if I can <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F4JMqIwo3XtmPCN46unwIkrsJlYYb3oNvaTmLqDQ6II/edit?usp=sharing">link</a> to the file.</p>

<p>
<iframe id="inline-test" title="inpage pgb display test" allowfullscreen="true" scr="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F4JMqIwo3XtmPCN46unwIkrsJlYYb3oNvaTmLqDQ6II/edit?usp=sharing"></iframe>
  </p>
  
<p>Sure is easy to paste in the html code.</p>
