<p>This is a page for playing around with embedding windows to Google Docs in a Gh page using an i-frame. The page is displaying using the .io page. I'm not sure yet 
  how to incorporate this into our practical display of the PGB file. </p>
<p>Here is what I have learned so far. </p>
<ul>
  <li>For the Google doc to properly display on Github, sharing must be set so that anyone with the link can see the file.</li>
  <li>It must also be set to share to the web using File/Share/Publish to web/Embed. An iframe tag will be created for you to use.</li>
  <li>I will play around more with the frame controls, but adding width="100%" and height="600" to the iframe gives a window that runs the full width of 
    the screen
  <li>Also set the embed doc to automatically republish if the data changes.</li>
  <li>You can set up the Google sheet to just show one page or the whole workbook.</li>
  <li>It takes a few minutes for the changes to ripple through.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I think we can make this work. </p>
<p>I couldn't publish the PGB list Google sheet to the web, so here is a different one I used for the experiment.</p>  
<p>New iframe link below <br/>
  <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTStJlK9iHyZth7LGiM5fpyZUS8plJKTXQzySA4Bz3bmcopurWQxtZwNSNCTVX_UGP_vooiyh4Pq-sb/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>
