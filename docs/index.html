<h1>pgb-viewer-test</h1>

<p>This is a page for playing around with embedding windows to Google Docs in a Gh page using an i-frame. I'm trying it now with an IO page which seems to be required.</p>
<p>Now I am editing the file in docs folder which seems to be the place that's being published. </p>
<p>Well, so far, the page doesn't seem to be updating. I am changing to a different spread sheet though that i can share with anyone. </p>

<p>Let's also see if I can <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTStJlK9iHyZth7LGiM5fpyZUS8plJKTXQzySA4Bz3bmcopurWQxtZwNSNCTVX_UGP_vooiyh4Pq-sb/pubhtml">link</a> to the file.</p>

<p>OK. Changing to width=100% spreads the window across the full screen. Still not seeing the iframe itself though. Oh wait! Copy the iframe link from the GD itself.</p>
<p>New iframe link below <br/>
  <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTStJlK9iHyZth7LGiM5fpyZUS8plJKTXQzySA4Bz3bmcopurWQxtZwNSNCTVX_UGP_vooiyh4Pq-sb/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>
</p>
<p>The one i was using... 
<iframe id="inline-test" title="inpage pgb display test" width="100%" scr="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTStJlK9iHyZth7LGiM5fpyZUS8plJKTXQzySA4Bz3bmcopurWQxtZwNSNCTVX_UGP_vooiyh4Pq-sb/pubhtml"></iframe>
  </p>
  
<p>Sure is easy to paste in the html code.</p>
