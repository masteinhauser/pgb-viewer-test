<h1>pgb-viewer-test with Google sheet filtered to OCA</h1>

<p>This is a page for playing around with embedding lists of Open Project PGB members in a GitHub page using a Google sheet and the iframe tag. If we can 
  get this working smoothly, we can set up the PGB roster to be auto-displayed in GH (or elsewhere) by pulling data from Salesforce to the Google sheet. </p>
<p>Look into alternatives to iframes. iframes are somewhat limited. possibily HTML5 web components. </p>
<p>Here is what I have learned so far. </p>
<ul>
  <li>For the Google doc to properly display on Github, sharing must be set so that anyone with the link can see the file.</li>
  <li>It must also be set to share to the web using File/Share/Publish to web/Embed. An iframe tag will be created for you to use.</li>
  <li>I will play around more with the frame controls, but adding width="100%" and height="600" to the iframe gives a window that runs the full width of 
    the screen
  <li>Also set the embed doc to automatically republish if the data changes.</li>
  <li>You can set up the Google sheet to just show one page or the whole workbook.</li>
  <li>It takes a few minutes for the changes to ripple through.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the iframe link copied from the current spread sheet. Width is set to 700, height to 300.</p>  
<p>New iframe link below <br/>
  <iframe width="700" height="300" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT38MUZFWO1ISzQWC6wSulN7IJCmYdSOIxBiofgO4c8mRF0hOuLEO59bW6McK2Lm0DgJkpaPLAf38AI/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>
