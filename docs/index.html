<h1>pgb-viewer-test</h1>

<p>This is a page for playing around with embedding windows to Google Docs in a Gh page using an i-frame. I'm trying it now with an IO page which seems to be required.</p>
<p>Now I am editing the file in docs folder which seems to be the place that's being published. </p>

<iframe id="inline-test"
  title="inpage pgb display test"
  width="600"
  scr="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dGzWAnwtO8s455K4vArdIrfEh1bxsbl5BD937WUHSjs/edit?usp=sharing"></iframe>
  </p>
  
<p>Sure is easy to paste in the html code.</p>
